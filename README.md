# Xenos
Staženou složku Xenos doporučuji hodit do C:\ (Jsou tam nastavené configy, kde se cheat snaží najít slzku z C:\)

Aktualní verze cheatu je 1.4 (Vždy když bude upozornění na discordu, odkaz bude vždy odkazovat sem)

V této verzi cheatu se mi podařilo opravit cheat na VAC net a Panoramu. Něco se pokazilo v chams, medal changeru a trošku aimbotu. Zbytek funguje jak by normálně měl. V Aimbotu to trošku blbne s famasem. (Zbytek jsem si zatím nevšiml, kdyžtak mě opravte). U M4A1_Silencer se deaktivuje aimbot (vůbec nevím proč), takže když hrajete s M4A1_Silencer, musíte si vždy zapnout Active a nastavit Smoooth + Fov. Dále se mi nějak sekl skin na M4A4, ale ten si orpavit můžete samotní v cheatu a pak si ho jen uložit.


Types of Cool Downs and Bans that include Xenos;

Unrankd Cooldown: In a recent effort to slow down and deter cheaters, Valve has implemented a wins-per-day restriction for unranked players. While unranked, you are limited to 2 wins per day until you receive your rank. I have heard that ties count as wins when the system calculates your rank, but I can't confirm this.

Overwatch: Minorly Disruptive: This is a cooldown for those convicted of being minorly disruptive by Overwatch. Minorly disruptive means that the player was griefing (intentionally ruining the game for the other players).

Overwatch: Majorly Disruptive: This is a permanent ban for those convicted of cheating by Overwatch. These ARE NOT VAC bans, but it is common for a VAC ban to follow an Overwatch ban as the cheat used gets detected.

VAC Ban: VAC stands for Valve Anti-Cheat. VAC bans are permanet and are triggered by the VAC system detecting cheats on your computer while playing on a VAC protected server.

Account Untrusted Ban: No one outside of Valve knows for sure exactly what triggers these bans. However, according to Valve themselve's, account untrusted bans are 100% correct and will eventually become a VAC ban. These types of bans do not appear on your profile until they become VAC bans.
